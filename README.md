Classification exercises going through the Data Science pipeline:

Acquire Data
Prepare Data
Explore Data
Evaluate Data

In this repo, I review the classification method for machine learning.

I use data acquisition and prepare and clean the data. Preparation included dropping nulls, renaming columns, creating dummy columns etc..

The next step I practiced using data visualizations for exploration to find features for our machine learning model.

Afterwards, I practiced conducting statistics tests including ttest and chi2^2 tests in order to confirm independence or correlations with certain features.

Next,I practiced using multiple different algorithms including decision tree, random forest, logistic regression, and k-nearest neighbor in order to find the best hyperparameters and use for a model.

From there I practiced splitting my data into train, validate, and test and used my train dataframe to fit and train my model of choice. I used methods to find probability of categorical outcome and confusion matrices to yield the best accuracy for my model.

Lastly, I practiced testing my model for the best accuracy.
